“Problems of unbalancedness with applications in R”
“Vahid Ahmadi”

In this file you have an R file, R markdown, and HTML file. My R code is runnable with:


1. Edit the file's location in part 2.4
2. Also make sure all of the libraries in part 2 are already installed
3. In each part depends on the concept, I may use different dataset. But the methods and codes are general and we could apply to any dataset.
